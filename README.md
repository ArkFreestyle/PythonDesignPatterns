# Python Design Patterns

Design Patterns that I'm studying while reading the book: Python 3 Object Oriented Programming by Dusty Phillips.<br>
Patterns covered:
1. Iterator Pattern
    * hello
1. Decorator Pattern
1. Observer Pattern
1. Strategy Pattern
1. State Pattern
1. Singleton Pattern
1. Template Pattern
1. Adapter Pattern
    * Use this when you want two interfaces to interact with each other.
        * Eg: Database drivers, anything that works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
1. Facade Pattern
    * Use this when you have a complex system which needs a simpler interface (facade) for the user.
        * Eg: In python, the requests library provides a facade for the more complex http library.
1. Flyweight Pattern
    * Use this when have huge memory consuming code and want to conserve resources.
        * Eg: A program that opens lots of files, creates lots of objects etc.
1. Command Pattern
    * Use this when you want to decouple an action from an invocation.
1. Abstract Factory Pattern
    * Use this for creating super configurable systems.
1. Composite Pattern
    * Use this when you need to create tree like structures.
